# sar\_social\_stories

The SAR Social Stories game node was designed for use during the SAR Year 5
study. This program loads and launches the social stories game, using scripts
to list what the robot should be told to do and what to do in response to stuff
that happens in the game. It uses an SQLite database to store information about
the stories to tell, as well as to track which stories a player has already
heard. This information is used to personalize which stories the player should
hear next based on which story questions they got wrong and which stories
they've already heard. The program uses ROS to communicate with a SAR Opal game
(on a tablet or on a PC) via a rosbridge\_server websocket connection and with
the robot via the robot\_command node.

## Usage

`python ss_game_node.py session participant`

Arguments:

- session
    - Indicates which session we should run so the appropriate game scripts can
      be loaded. Defaults to -1, which indicates that the demo session should
      be loaded.

- participant
    - Indicates which participant is playing so personalized game scripts can
      be loaded. Defaults to DEMO, which indicates that the demo session should
      be loaded.

### Configuration

#### Game config

The game reads in the configuration file `ss_config.json`, which is located in
the `src/` directory. An example config file named `ss_config.example.json` is
provided.

The options you can set in the config file include:

- script\_path: The relative path from the `src/` directory to the directory
  containing game scripts.

- story\_script\_path: The relative path from the `script_path` directory to
  the directory containing story scripts. For example, the demo story scripts
  are in a subdirectory of the main game script directory named
  `story_scripts`. This field is optional. If not set, it is assumed that the
  story scripts are in the main script directory specifed by `script_path`.

- session\_script\_path: The relative path from the `script_path` directory to
  the directory containing session scripts. For example, the demo session
  scripts are in a subdirectory of the main game script directory named
  `session_scripts`. This field is optional. If not set, it is assumed that
  the session scripts are in the main script directory specifed by
  `script_path`.

- database: The relative path from the `src/` directory to the SQLite database
  file, plus the filename of the database. For example, the demo game uses the
  database `socialstories.db` in the `src/` directory. This field is optional.
  If not set, it is assumed that the database file is `src/socialstories.db`.

- percent\_correct\_to\_level: The percentage of questions about a story that
  a participant has to have gotten correct in the last session to level up in
  this session, written as a decimal value. The demo game does not use this
  field since there is only one demo story, and thus, no need to level up. This
  field is optional. If not set, the default value is 0.75 (75% correct to
  level up).

#### Log config

The game uses the Python logging module to direct log output to four places:

1. the console
2. debug log file
3. error log file
4. rosout

The game reads in the logging configuration file `ss\_log\_config.json`, which
is located in the `src/` directory.

The options you can set in this log config file include where log files should
be saved, the general format of each log message, and the log level to record
to each log location. We also list the modules that are logging stuff, since we
can set their individual log levels if we so desire as well as list which
logging handlers will be connected to the module. See the [Python documentation
for more details](https://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.html).

If the game cannot read the log config file, it will default to using the
logging module's default setup, logging messages at level DEBUG to "ss.log".

It is worth mentioning that rospy's log system uses the Python logging module
on the back end. If you want to mess with the configuration of rosout or any
other ROS logging, the default config file is generally located at
"$ROS\_ROOT/../../etc/ros/python\_logging.conf" and follows the general Python
logging configuration conventions. According to the [rospy logging
documentation](http://wiki.ros.org/rospy/Overview/Logging#Advanced:_Override_Logging_Configuration),
you can override the location by setting the `ROS\_PYTHON\_LOG\_CONFIG\_FILE`
environment variable. You can also change the ROS log level without messing
with this config file by passing the `log_level` parameter to the
`rospy.init_node()` call made in "ss\_game\_node.py". Currently, the log level
DEBUG is passed in to the init\_node call.

By default, ROS saves a node's log files to `~/.ros/log/` or `$ROS\_ROOT/log`.
Note that rosout only gets log messages after the node is fully initialized, so
the ROS rosout log file will likely be missing the initial messages. See the
[rospy logging documentation](http://wiki.ros.org/rospy/Overview/Logging) for
more.


### Demo version

To run the demo version of the game, run without arguments (the argument
defaults indicate the demo game should be loaded), enter `-1` as the session
number, and/or enter `DEMO` as the participant string.

The demo game uses the config file `ss_config.demo.json`, game scripts located
in the `game_scripts/` directory, and the database file `src/socialstories.db`.

To run a full demo, you will need the following ROS nodes:
- roscore
- rosbridge webserver (for Opal device websocket connection)
- an Opal device (running
  [SAR-Opal-base](https://github.com/personal-robots/SAR-opal-base))
- a game command node (e.g., [sar\_game\_command\_sender](https://github.com/personal-robots/sar_game_command_sender))
- a robot node (e.g.,
  [sar\_robot\_simulator](https://github.com/personal-robots/sar_robot_simulator))
- the robot translation node ([sar\_robot\_translation](https://github.com/personal-robots/sar_robot_translation))
- this game

### Graphics

The game, including the demo version, requires a set of graphics to be added to
the Opal device that is paired with this node. Due to licensing, the full set
of graphics required for the game is available on request from students in the
Personal Robots Group. Please email students in the group to inquire.

### Stories

Due to licensing, only a couple sample stories are provided in this repository.
These can imported into the database, and story scripts generated, using the
`source_ods/story-test-set.ods` spreadsheet and the provided
`ss_process_story_ods.py` script (described below). The full game requires a
set of 42 stories. This full set is available on request from students in the
Personal Robots Group. Please email students in the group to inquire.

## Game scripts

The program will attempt to read interaction scripts from the directory listed
in the config file. For the demo game, the interaction scripts are located in
the `game_scripts/` directory. This directory has two sub-directories:
`session_scripts/`, which contains all session-level scripts, and
`story_scripts/`, which contains all story-specific scripts.

### Session scripts

By default, the demo session uses the `demo.txt` session script. When you
specify a particular session, the session script named `session-\[NUMBER\].txt`
will be used. For example, if you are loading session 2, the session script
`session-2.txt` will be used.

Script lines should be tab-delimited. Look at the demo script located in
`session_scripts/demo.txt` for an example.

The session script lists what happens during a game session. It should list, in
order, the actions the program should take. These actions include the
following, which are described in more detail below:

- ADD
- SET
- ROBOT
- OPAL
- WAIT
- REPEAT
- STORY
- QUESTION

#### ADD

`ADD` is used to add a list of robot commands that can be used in response to a
particular trigger. Triggers may be actions the user takes, such as selecting a
correct or incorrect response for a question, input from sensors, or a
particular repeating action in the script, such as an introductory comment
before telling a story. `ADD` should list the trigger and the file containing
the list of robot commands. For example, the following command will load the
commands listed in `incorrect.txt` as response options for incorrect actions
taken by the user:

`ADD INCORRECT_RESPONSE incorrect.txt`

Currently, the following lists can be added:

- CORRECT\_RESPONSES: Responses to correct user actions
- INCORRECT\_RESPONSES: Responses to incorrect user actions
- ANSWER\_FEEDBACK: Responses indicating which action was correct (regardless
  of whether the user performed a correct or incorrect action)
- START\_RESPONSES: Responses to the user selecting a "start" button
- NO\_RESPONSES: Responses to the user selecting a "no" button
- STORY\_INTROS: Introductory comment before telling a story
- STORY\_CLOSINGS: Closing comment after telling a story
- TIMEOUT\_CLOSINGS: Responses for when the maximum game time is reached

#### SET

`SET` will set configuration options or other constants. Currently, you can set
the following:

- MAX\_INCORRECT\_RESPONSES: The maximum number of incorrect responses the user
  can provide for a question before the game moves on.
- MAX\_GAME\_TIME: The maximum amount of time, in minutes, that the user can
  play the game before it exits.
- MAX\_STORIES: The maximum number of stories to tell in one game session.

For example, the following commands will set the maximum incorrect responses to
2 and the maximum game time allowed to 10 minutes:

`SET MAX_INCORRECT_RESPONSES    2`

`SET MAX_GAME_TIME 10`

#### ROBOT

`ROBOT` is used to send the robot a speech and/or action command. For DO
actions, write it as a string containing what the robot should say and the
actions the robot should do, following the format for RobotCommand messages
defined in
[sar\_robot\_command\_msgs](https://github.com/personal-robots/sar_robot_command_msgs
"/sar_robot_command_msgs"). For example, the following would send a command to
the robot to say "Hi, I am a robot" while smiling:

`ROBOT   DO "Hi <smile> I am a robot!"`

You can also send other RobotCommand messages, for example:

`ROBOT  SLEEP`

The robot commands also include a few special commands that indicate that one
of the robot commands from the `STORY_INTROS` or `STORY_CLOSINGS` lists should
be used, such as:

`ROBOT  STORY_INTRO`

#### OPAL

`OPAL` is used to send commands to the SAR Opal game. You can include the full
command on the line, following the format defined in
[sar\_opal\_msgs](https://github.com/personal-robots/sar_opal_msgs
"/sar_opal_msgs") for OpalCommand messages. However, use the command name (not
the number!) on the line -- so you'd write `CLEAR` instead of `6`. You can also
use the command `LOAD_ALL` followed by the name of a text file that contains a
list of objects to load with their associated properties to load a particular
set of objects all at once. Similarly, the command `LOAD_STORY` will load the
graphics for the next story.

For example, the following would send opal commands to clear the game scene,
set up the next story scene, load the pictures for the next story, and set the
correct responses for the next story:

`OPAL    CLEAR`

`OPAL    SETUP_STORY_SCENE`

`OPAL    LOAD_STORY`

`OPAL    SET_CORRECT`

#### WAIT

`WAIT` is used to wait for a response from the user via a particular trigger
before proceeding in the game. A timeout is specified so that if no response is
received, script playback will continue after that amount of time. The timeout
should be specified in seconds. For example, the following would wait for a
response to a `START` button press and would timeout after 10 seconds:

`WAIT    START  10`

#### REPEAT

`REPEAT` allows you to specify a script that should be repeated multiple times
before continuing on to the next part of the main session script. You also must
specify how many times the script should be repeated by either providing an
integer or providing the name of a set constant, such as `MAX_STORIES`. The
script will be repeated that many times or until the maximum game time has
elapsed, whichever is reached first.

The following example would repeat the `demo-stories.txt` script for
`MAX_STORIES` iterations or until the maximum game time elapsed:

`REPEAT  MAX_STORIES    demo-stories.txt`

#### STORY

`STORY` indicates that the next story for this session should be played back.
Since which stories are played back depends on the session, participant, and
personalization, this can only be determined at the start of a game session --
not ahead of time. Thus, we use the `STORY` command to indicate that it's time
to play back the next story. This command requires no arguments, as the program
will keep its own list of which stories should be played back next, so a line
will look like this:

`STORY`

That said: Depending on your script, you may want to specify that a new story
should be selected before attempting to load the story or play back the story.
A `STORY` line may optionally take a string argument "SETUP", which indicates
that the next story should be selected. You will then need to use the usual
script lines for loading and playing back the story.

`STORY  SETUP`

#### QUESTION

`QUESTION` is used to set meta-information about a question that will be asked.
This command is used so we can record and track user responses to questions in
the database. This command requires two arguments: The question type and the
question number. The type could be any tag you like, so long as it corresponds
exactly with the question type tags you use in your database. The three
question types used in the stories provided for this game are _emotion_, _ToM_
(i.e., theory of mind), and _order_. Since there may be multiple questions for
a story of the same type, the question number uniquely identifies which one
this is. While it may be possible to simply have a question counter in the
code, rather than listing the number in the script, we think listing the number
is better on the off-chance that questions appear out of order. Here are some
examples:

`QUESTION emotion 1`

`QUESTION order 2`

### Story scripts

The story scripts follow the same format as the main session scripts. See the
example in `story_scripts/demo-story-1.txt`.

## Tracking player progress

### Database

The program stores information about the stories, questions asked about
stories, and stories the player has already played in an SQLite database.

#### Database initialization

You can initialize the database by running the script `ss_init_db.py`:

`python ss_init_db.py [-h] [-d [DB]]`

Optional arguments:

- -h, --help
    - Show the help message and exit.

- -d [DB], --database [DB]
    - The database filename for storing story and question info. Defaults to
      `socialstories.db`.

#### Filling the database

The script `ss_process_story_ods.py` will read .ods spreadsheets containing
story info for the game. It will generate game scripts that will be used to
load graphics and tell the robot how to read aloud the story, and add
meta-information about the stories and the questions to ask about each story to
the database.

Note that the script assumes a very particular organization of the
spreadsheet. An example spreadsheet containing two stories is provided in
`source_ods/story-test-set.ods`.

In addition, the script clears existing data from several tables, so you should
run the script with all the spreadsheets you need to import at once. If you run
the script again later, some or all of the previously imported data may be
deleted.

Run as follows:

`python ss_process_story_ods.py [-h] [-d [DB]] [-o [OUT_DIR]] ods_files
[ods_files...]`

Positional arguments:

- ods\_files
    - A list of .ods spreadsheets containing stories for the SAR Social Stories
      game.

Optional arguments:
- -h, --help
    - Show the help message and exit.

- -d [DB], --database [DB]
    - The database filename for storing story and question info. Defaults to
      `socialstories.db`.

- -o [OUT\_DIR], --output\_dir [OUT\_DIR]
    - The output directory where generated story scripts will be saved.
      Defaults to the current directory.

### Personalization

There are two kinds of personalization. First is the level of the story
presented. Players start at level 1. If they get sufficient emotion questions
correct about the stories they hear, in the next session, they are leveled up.
The percentage of questions they need to get correct to level up can be set in
the config file, and defaults to 75%.

Second, we personalize which story a player hears next. This is determined by a
couple guiding principles:

- The player should hear stories that target emotions that the player needs
  practice with, as determined by their performance on the story questions
  (which ask about emotions that characters felt in the story). So if a player
  has gotten questions about the emotions "sad" and "surprised" incorrect in
  the last session, we should select stories to play next that target these
  emotions, if possible.
- The player should hear at least one new story each session, if possible.
- If a player has to hear a previously heard story, play a story involving the
  target emotions, and/or the story that has been heard least often and least
  recently.
- The player should never hear the same story twice in the same session (even
  at different levels).

We query the database to determine the player's past performance and stories
heard.

## Testing

We are using python's unittest framework for testing. Some of the tests require
an initialized and filled database, so you will need to create one prior to
running the tests.

Steps:
- Initialize the database with the `ss_init_db.py` script as described above.
- Fill the database with the full set of 42 SAR stories using the
  `ss_process_story_ods.py` script. If you use only the example stories, a
  couple tests may need to be modified, since they assume that the full set of
  stories will be present and can be referenced.
- Run `python -m unittest discover` from the `src/` directory. This will
  automatically find all files in that directory containing tests, and will run
  all the tests.

## Bugs and issues

Please report all bugs and issues on the [sar\_social\_stories github issues
page](https://github.com/personal-robots/sar_social_stories/issues).

## TODO

- Consider listing the mapping of session script files to sessions in a config
  file.
- Add joint attention and turn taking tags to indicate opportunities for a user
  to demonstrate these skills. Waiting on specifications for this from the SAR
  team.
- If the game is waiting for a response from the user, it will not respond to
  GameCommands immediately. GameCommands (such as PAUSE) only take effect
  between script lines, so the game would need to finish dealing with one line
  (such as a line instructing the game to wait for a user response) before it
  will deal with the GameCommand. It would be useful to be able to PAUSE
  immediately regardless of what is happening in the game.
- The game will only wait for one response at a time, so if the robot is
  speaking and we are waiting for a "robot not speaking" response before
  continuing, any user response made while the robot is speaking will be
  ignored, even if it is the type of response that we will be waiting for next.
